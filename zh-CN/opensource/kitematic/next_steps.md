You've just created your first pull request to Kitematic!

## Take the development challenge

Now that youâ€™ve had some practice, try adding another feature to Kitematic on your own.

As you learned in the previous exercise, adding the container ID to the container **Settings** tab is fairly simple.

Let's provide another missing piece of information for Kitematic users:

"*When I look at an active container in Kitematic, I want to know what command the container is currently running*."

![An active container in Kitematic](images/kitematic_gui_container_id.png)

In a terminal window, users can get this by looking at running containers with: `docker ps`

As an exercise, implement the code changes needed to display the current container's running command. When you are ready to share the new mini feature, create a PR for it.
