## What is Docker Store?

For publishers, Docker Store is the best way for you to distribute and sell your
Dockerized content. Publish your software through the Docker Store to experience
the benefits below:

* Access to Docker’s large and growing customer-base. Docker has
experienced rapid adoption, and is wildly popular in dev-ops
environments. Docker users have pulled images over four billion times,
and they are increasingly turning to the Docker Store as the canonical
source for high-quality, curated content.

* Customers can try or buy your software, right from your product listing. Your
content is accessible for installation, trial, and purchase from the Docker
Store and the Docker CLI.

* Use our licensing support.  We can limit access to your software to
a) logged-in users, b) users who have purchased a license, or
c) all Docker users.  We’ll help you manage and control your distribution.

* We'll handle checkout.  You don’t have to set up your own digital e-commerce
site when you sell your content through the Docker Store.  We'll even help you
set pricing—and you can forget about the rest.

* Seamless updates and upgrades.  We tell customers when your content
has upgrades or updates available, right inside their Docker host product.

* It’s a win-win for our platform and publishers: great content improves our
ecosystem, and our flexible platform helps you bring your content to market.

* Achieve the Docker Certified quality mark.  Publisher container images and
plugins that meet the quality, security, and support criteria of the program
will display a “Docker Certified” badge within the Docker Store and external
marketing.  

### Distribution Models

The Docker Store welcomes free and open-source content, as well as software sold
directly by publishers.  We support the following commercial models:

#### Paid-via-Docker Content

This is content for which customers transact via Docker, as described in the
publisher agreement.  Paid-via-Docker content includes both software than can be
deployed on a host, as well as software that runs in the cloud and can be
accessed by the customer via an ambassador container (containerized cloud
services, for example).

#### Free Content

Free content is provided free-of-charge, and customers may pull it from the
Docker Hub either at their discretion or upon license acceptance, at the
publisher’s discretion.  You agree that you will not charge customers for any
Free Content by making it available for purchase outside of the Docker Store.
